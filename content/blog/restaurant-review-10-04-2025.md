Walk into the inviting doors after a drizzling day on the Ave, and the first thing that I inhale is the aromatic essence of spit-rotated beef and smoky lamb mixed with herb-flavored rice. A cramped and cozy venue, this Mediterranean restaurant stimulates the senses with its vibrant colors and constant, bustling foot traffic. Slightly further across the main aisle is the Palestinian flag, displayed proudly in support of the refugees suffering from the Israel-Gaza war.

Recommended by many fellow Huskies, Aladdin sits at the top of my five restaurants to dine at during the academic year, especially when I get bored by sandwiches and burgers from Lander's Local Point. Standing behind several people, as I prepare to order with my friend, I struggle to read the tiny text of the wall-topped menu angled peripherally to my vision. I forget that a menu exists on their website as I strain my neck to make out the different types of shawarma and gyro options. (A QR code to the online menu would have been quite appropriate!)

After waiting in line for a few minutes, I scan the venue's surroundings. Besides the inconvenient appearance of a big red pole, the view is primarily unobstructed. Seats and tables are currently at about half capacity, arranged in pairs or fours, highlighting the lack of solo-seat options showcased in Gina Mei's *Learning to Cook for One*. Discussions between couples and friend groups are relatively animated, fostering an emotionally welcome and laid back atmosphere in the restaurant. No one eats alone here.

"Next!" the employee standing behind the counter calls, while another worker sizzles a fat slab of lamb nearby him. It's time for me to order. I settle on a Gyro Lamb and Beef Sandwich ($10.50) and fumble to get my phone out and tap the NFC scanner with Apple Pay. Default tipping starts at 18%, a sordid reminder of the expectation that consumers subsidize significant portions of employee wages (with most companies dodging responsibility). A playful ding and a quick buzz later, I get a receipt with the number 45 attached.

My friend orders a chicken shawarma without much hassle, and we attempt to choose an adequately clean table. The first time we sit down, I immediately notice brownish and oily stains on the lightly-touched wood and motion to sit somewhere else. Settling into the second spot, I notice a Shanasheel building design hoisted on the upper part of the wall directly in front of me. The designs, colored in patterned green, yellow, and red, were used in the 1920s and 30s for domestic buildings in Baghdad and Basra, a notable reference to Middle Eastern roots and authenticity.

I unwrap my gyro, stomach grumbling. The custom home-brand packaging is a little messy but serviceable. Taking my first bite, I am immediately greeted by a swirl of juicy, tender beef spread with tzatziki sauce and cooked cabbage. What is somewhat lacking in the cleanliness department of the venue is more than made up for by the amazing taste and texture of the gyro. The pita is of perfect thickness and fluffiness, blending perfectly with the filling. My friend continues chomping on the chicken shawarma contentedly.

Finishing the final bites, I wipe my mouth with the standard brown napkin provided. After a filling dinner, I stroll to dispose the wrapper and the bag. My friend and I walk through the narrow aisle one more time, and we turn right to head back to our dorms, bringing groceries from the nearby HMart.

Overall, I would definitely recommend going to Aladdin's, and would go again soon. There are a plethora of decent options, from gyro to shawarma to falafel, with side options including their famous Aladdin fries. Granted, the venue is not the most well-maintained. Strangely enough, I find that there is an inverse correlation between how good the venue looks and how delicious the food is. Since the restaurant provides seating, I would encourage bringing friends together, like I did, as consuming food is a social activity. Pricing is fairly cheap compared to other restaurants nearby, and its claim of providing the "best 'bang for the buck" (Aladdin website) is certainly delivered. Waiting times are acceptable, and the menu could be more accessible in person. Finally, if there's one thing I've learned, it seems that college students have pretty good taste when it comes to recommending restaurants!
